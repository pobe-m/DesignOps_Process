## In plain words

You hand it a **project brief** (a TOR — the document that says what to build). It reads the brief,
figures out who the users are and what matters to them, picks a look and feel, plans the screens, and
**builds a clickable demo app** — then checks its own work for accessibility and quality before
handing it off.

> **Goes in:** a brief (PDF / Word / Notion / Google Docs).
> **Comes out:** a clear written spec **+** a working demo you can open in a browser.

Think of it as an assembly line for the early design of an app: each station does one job and won't
pass the work on until it's correct. Good for designers, PMs, and engineers who want to go from
"here's the scope" to "here's something to react to" fast.

## How it works (the pipeline)

Every stage produces a file and passes through a **gate** (an automatic check) before the next stage
runs. It works for any kind of product — there are no fixed industry templates.

## ✨ Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **Product Intelligence** | Infers 10 measurable dimensions (each with evidence + confidence) → an open `design_directives` object. No fixed industry presets. |
| 🎨 **Aesthetic Direction** | Picks one of **138 named design systems** (apple, linear, stripe, resend…) or an archetype, resolves it to **contrast-checked** tokens. Optionally infers the look from a TOR mockup. |
| 🛡️ **Real gates, not vibes** | Every stage has a zero-dependency validator. The audit gate is a *script* that recomputes WCAG contrast from `globals.css` (oklch→sRGB, light + dark) and lints for hardcodes + emoji — exit 1 blocks handoff. |
| 🔁 **Scored quality loop** | Step 4.6 critique = 6 weighted dimensions + Nielsen's 10 heuristics + an anti-slop gate (Banned Defaults). |
| 🧩 **19 design skills, folded in** | ux-writing, brandkit (DTCG tokens), image-to-code, migrate-design-system, performance, governance — vendored, standalone. See [`references/SKILLS.md`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/SKILLS.md). |
| 📦 **Standalone** | The whole pipeline depends on no external repo — design system, brand library, and token kit are all vendored in. |

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
# 1. Place your TOR at docs/tor.pdf  (or try the bundled sample — see below)

# 2. Run the full pipeline (standalone — no --ds needed)
bash .claude/skills/designops-pipeline/scripts/run_pipeline.sh --tor docs/tor.pdf --out ./output

# 3. Generate the prototype from the draft (inside Claude Code)
/generate-prototype --all

# 4. Run it
cd output/prototype && npm install && npm run dev   # → http://localhost:3000
```

> 📱 **Test on a phone:** the dev server prints a `Network: http://<lan-ip>:3000` URL — open it on a
> phone on the same Wi-Fi. The scaffolded `next.config.ts` auto-allows your LAN IPs, so the page
> hydrates and works (Next blocks cross-origin dev HMR otherwise). Most TORs here are mobile-first.

> 💡 No TOR handy? Use the bundled sample (Thai HIS TOR — also proves non-English reading):
> `--tor .claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/sample-tor.md`

> ⚠️ **Run inside Claude Code.** The runner does deterministic prep (extract TOR, scan the DS,
> stage prompts) and prints an agent checklist; Claude does the reading & generation. In a plain
> terminal it only stages prompt files and produces no artifacts.

## 🔧 Pipeline at a glance

| Step | What it does | Output | Gate |
|------|--------------|--------|------|
| **1+2** | Read TOR → 8 categories + scoring criteria | `brief.md` · `brief.json` | `validate_brief.py` |
| **2.5** | Product Intelligence — 10 dims → `design_directives` | `intelligence.json` | `validate_intelligence.py` |
| **2.6** | Aesthetic Direction — pick + resolve tokens | `aesthetic.json` · `brand.config.json` | `validate_aesthetic.py` |
| **3** | Refine user flows from directives | `flows.json` | `validate_flows.py` |
| **3.5** | Screens from flows + DS mapping | `screen-inventory.json` · `design-first-draft.md` | `validate_screens.py` |
| **4** | Scaffold the Next.js prototype | `output/prototype/` | — |
| **4.6** | Scored critique → auto-fix critical + quick wins | `docs/critique.md` | (agent) |
| **4.7** | **Audit gate** — token + WCAG + no-emoji | `docs/audit-report.md` | `audit_prototype.py` 🔴 exit 1 |
| **4.8** | Storybook QA (opt-in) | — | `addon-a11y` axe pass |
| **5** | Figma screens | Figma file | (Figma MCP) |

## 🧠 Product Intelligence Layer (Step 2.5)

Between the brief and the UI, the pipeline infers **10 measurable product dimensions** — each with
**evidence + confidence** — and rolls them up into an open **`design_directives`** object. Any
domain is expressible as a vector; there are no fixed presets.

`User Types · Expertise · Goals · Core Tasks · Workflow Complexity · Data Density · Error Tolerance · Accessibility · Compliance · Decision Criticality`

```
design_directives = { density_target 1–5, guidance_level, safeguard_level,
                      a11y_target, mandatory_flows[], navigation_model, trust_emphasis }
```

`validate_intelligence.py` enforces **cross-dimension invariants** (e.g. `safety_critical ⇒
error_tolerance low/zero`, public-sector ⇒ AAA) and **confidence gating** (low confidence →
wireframe-level output + a human gate). Spec: [`intelligence-layer.md`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/intelligence-layer.md).

---

## 🎨 Aesthetic Direction (Step 2.6)

`design_directives` decides the *functional* shape; Step 2.6 decides the **look**. It commits a
visual direction and resolves it into concrete tokens — so the prototype earns a real aesthetic
instead of the neutral shadcn default ("design slop").

- **138-brand library** — `references/aesthetics/design-systems/library/<name>/DESIGN.md`
  (apple, linear-app, stripe, vercel, notion, resend, brutalism, glassmorphism, luxury…).
  Browse: `python3 …/aesthetics/scripts/design_systems.py list | search <term> | show <name>`.
- **Anti-slop first** — name the one `mood_adjective` the result must earn before any token.
- **From a mockup** — if the TOR ships a screenshot, infer the direction from it ([`image-to-code.md`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/image-to-code.md)).
- **Gate** — `validate_aesthetic.py` **recomputes WCAG contrast from the hex values itself**
  (never trusts the agent), requires the chosen system to resolve in the library, and forces
  `a11y_target`/`density_target` to echo `design_directives`.

Output `aesthetic.json` + a ready-to-apply `output/brand.config.json` for `/generate-prototype`.

---

## 🔁 Quality loop — scored, then gated

**Step 4.6 — Critique (scored)** · [`critique-framework.md`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/critique-framework.md) → [`design-review.md`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/design-review.md)

- Score **6 weighted dimensions** (Hierarchy 20 · Consistency 20 · Accessibility 20 · Usability 20 · Responsiveness 10 · Performance 10) → weighted overall (≤6 = rework).
- Flag **Nielsen's 10 heuristics** by number · run the **anti-slop gate** (Banned Defaults: pure #000/#fff, identical cards, rainbow accents, emoji-as-icons, em-dash copy…).
- **Mobile lens** ([`mobile-usability.md`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/mobile-usability.md)) for mobile-first products — touch targets ≥44px, thumb reach, correct input types, 320px reflow, no hover-only. Also applied when screens are generated (Step 3.5).
- Auto-fix every 🔴 Critical + ⚡ Quick Win; log the rest for Dev.

**Step 4.7 — Audit gate (a real script)** · `audit_prototype.py`

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/designops-pipeline/scripts/audit_prototype.py \
  output/prototype --a11y AA --report output/prototype/docs/audit-report.md
```

| # | Gate | How it's checked | Result |
|---|------|------------------|--------|
| 1 | **Token compliance** | `lint_hardcodes.py` — no raw hex/px/ms or `bg-gray-500`-style palette | 🔴 block |
| 2 | **WCAG contrast** | recomputes ratios from `globals.css` (oklch→sRGB), light **and** dark, at the a11y target | 🔴 block |
| 3 | **UX copy** | `check_no_emoji.py` — no emoji / em-dash in product UI | 🔴 block |

> **Exit 1 = BLOCKED** — handoff/Figma is blocked until it passes. Categories are machine-checked,
> not eyeballed. It audits the **generated surface only** (`components/ui` and any `docs/` dir are
> auto-excluded), so just point it at the prototype — no `--scan` needed; add `--include-vendored` to audit everything.

**Step 4.7b — Runtime audit (optional)** · [`runtime-audit/`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/runtime-audit/README.md)

Renders the built page in headless Chrome (Playwright) to catch what source can't show — **axe-core**
(button/link names, image alt, `lang`, ARIA, landmarks, heading order), **hover/focus-state contrast**,
modal **focus-trap**, plus a render-based **anti-slop** report. Opt-in; skips cleanly without Playwright.
```bash
node scripts/runtime/audit_runtime.mjs out/index.html   # after npm run build, in the prototype
```

## ✅ Prerequisites

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Claude Code** | Drives the reading & generation. Without it the runner only stages prompts. **Required.** |
| **Node.js ≥ 18** | Build the prototype (`npm install && npm run dev`) + the token bridge. |
| **Python 3** | Every validator gate + the DS inventory scan. Zero-dependency. |
| **poppler** (`pdftotext`) | Better PDF text extraction. Optional — falls back to Claude reading the PDF. `brew install poppler`. |

---

## 🧪 Tests

```bash
bash .claude/skills/designops-pipeline/scripts/selftest.sh        # 44/44, runs on macOS stock bash 3.2
```

Covers bash-3.2 compatibility, every validator (valid passes / invalid fails), the aesthetic +
audit gates (fake brand, low contrast, hardcode, emoji all blocked), and the DTCG token gates.
**Run it after editing any script** in `.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/scripts/`.

---

## 🧱 Standalone design

The core pipeline depends on **no external repo**. The design system is vendored at
`./design-system/` (source-only, used for Step 3 *and* as the prototype base); the brand library
and DTCG token kit live under `references/`. `run_pipeline.sh` resolves `--ds` in order:
`TOR_DS_PATH` env → `./design-system` (in-repo) → `../shadcn-skills-design-starter` (fallback).

The `--handoff` token bridge (hex → oklch into a whitelabel repo) is **deprecated**. Under Model A
the DS is the imported `@npsin-oreo/design-system` package and theming is owned by Step 2.6 → the product
scaffold, so there is no token-bridge step in the normal flow. The flag is kept for back-compat only
against a repo that still ships `brand.config.json` + `npm run brand:build` (never the DS repo).
