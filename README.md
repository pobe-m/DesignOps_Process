## In plain words

You hand it **any product intent** — a full brief (a TOR), a PRD, a one-line idea, an existing product to
redesign, meeting notes. It normalises that into a factual brief (asking you only what it genuinely can't
infer), works out who the users are and what matters to them, picks a look and feel, finds the edge cases
and the screens, and **builds a clickable demo app** — then checks its own work for accessibility and
quality before handing it off. Test it, feed the results back, and it scores what to fix in the next round.

> **Goes in:** any intent (PDF / Word / Notion / Google Docs, or just a sentence).
> **Comes out:** a clear written spec **+** a working demo you can open in a browser.

Think of it as an assembly line for the early design of an app: each station does one job and won't
pass the work on until it's correct — and the thinner your input, the more it flags as a guess rather
than inventing facts. Good for designers, PMs, and engineers who want to go from "here's the scope" (or
"here's a hunch") to "here's something to react to" fast.

## How it works (the pipeline)

Every stage produces a file and passes through a **gate** (an automatic check) before the next stage
runs. It works for any kind of product — there are no fixed industry templates.

## ✨ Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| 🚪 **Any intent in (hourglass)** | A TOR, a PRD, a one-line idea, a redesign, notes — a thin 4-way gate normalises it into `brief.json`, sets a confidence floor, and asks you **only** the prototype-critical gaps it can't infer. The pipeline body never forks per input type. |
| 🔬 **Discover before design** | Personas / JTBD / pains (2.3), a **simulated interview → affinity map** (2.3b), and a conditional as-is **journey → opportunities** — all honesty-gated (simulation is never passed off as real research). Every `user_type` traces back to a persona. |
| 🧠 **Product Intelligence** | Infers 10 measurable dimensions (each with evidence + confidence) → an open `design_directives` object. No fixed industry presets. |
| 🧨 **Scenario edges (2.5b)** | The 10 dimensions pushed to their edge — concurrency, irreversible actions, withdrawn consent, abandonment — surfaced as **missing flows** *before* the screens exist (one altitude above the 3.7 screen-state edges). |
| 🎨 **Aesthetic Direction** | Picks one of **138 named design systems** (apple, linear, stripe, resend…) or an archetype, then resolves the **full identity token set** (surfaces, text, accent, border + dark theme — not just primary), **contrast-checked**, so the look actually flows into the prototype. Optionally infers it from a TOR mockup. |
| 🛡️ **Real gates, not vibes** | Every stage has a zero-dependency validator. The audit gate is a *script* with **11 checks** — hardcodes · WCAG contrast (light + dark) · UX copy · component-contracts · font-imports · theme-fidelity · directive-fidelity · screen-coverage · edge-coverage · font-fidelity · axis-fidelity — exit 1 blocks handoff. `finalize-prototype.sh` chains it (`--strict`) with the critique + usability integrity checks so the audit can't be skipped. |
| 🧵 **Intent makes it to the build** | A traceability spine carries the contractual scope end-to-end: every **Must** feature and scored must-have is provably served by a task, a screen, and a built route — checked, not assumed. |
| 🔁 **Scored quality loop → iteration** | Step 4.6 critique = 6 weighted dimensions + Nielsen's 10 heuristics + an anti-slop gate (Banned Defaults). Then **Step 4.9** scores real test feedback (`severity × reach × confidence`; observed > stated; systemic vs one-person quirk) into the next prototype's work-list — build → test → fix top-N → repeat until it converges. |
| 📐 **Typography + geometry + imagery** | Step 2.6 commits an explicit type hierarchy (weight-driven emphasis). Step 3.5 flags which screens need imagery → free-license sourcing with provenance + alt. Step 4.7b adds a render-based geometry audit (8pt grid · WCAG 2.2 target size · min text). |
| 🧩 **19 design skills, folded in** | ux-writing, brandkit (DTCG tokens), image-to-code, migrate-design-system, performance, governance — vendored into the skill. See [`references/SKILLS.md`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/SKILLS.md). |
| 📦 **Bring your own DS — no token** | **Model B (recommended):** point `--ds-src` at a local shadcn checkout (a Next app with `components/ui`); it's copied in and built with its own **public** deps — no package import, no GitHub Packages, no `GITHUB_TOKEN`. **Model A (legacy):** import a published `@scope/design-system` package (needs a token). The 138-brand library + token kit ship with the skill. |

---

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
# 1. Run the full pipeline. --ds points at YOUR shadcn DS (a local checkout with components/ui).
#    From a document, or from any intent — no GITHUB_TOKEN needed for Model B.
bash .claude/skills/designops-pipeline/scripts/run_pipeline.sh --tor docs/tor.pdf --ds ../shadcn-skills-design --out ./output
#    …or start from any intent, no document:
#    run_pipeline.sh --intent "a mobile app for splitting group expenses" --ds ../shadcn-skills-design --out ./output

# 2. Build the prototype base off your DS (Model B — copies it in, installs its own public deps, no token)
bash .claude/skills/designops-pipeline/scripts/setup-prototype.sh --out ./output --ds-src ../shadcn-skills-design

# 3. Generate the screens from the draft (inside Claude Code)
/generate-prototype --all

# 4. Run it
cd output/prototype && npm run dev   # → http://localhost:3000
```

> **Model A (legacy, needs a token):** to import a *published* DS package instead of a local checkout,
> `export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)` and run `setup-prototype.sh --out ./output --ds-pkg @scope/design-system@x.y.z`.

> 📱 **Test on a phone:** the dev server prints a `Network: http://<lan-ip>:3000` URL — open it on a
> phone on the same Wi-Fi. The scaffolded `next.config.ts` auto-allows your LAN IPs, so the page
> hydrates and works (Next blocks cross-origin dev HMR otherwise). Most TORs here are mobile-first.

> 💡 No TOR handy? Use the bundled sample (Thai HIS TOR — also proves non-English reading):
> `--tor .claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/sample-tor.md`

> ⚠️ **Run inside Claude Code.** The runner does deterministic prep (extract TOR, scan the DS,
> stage prompts) and prints an agent checklist; Claude does the reading & generation. In a plain
> terminal it only stages prompt files and produces no artifacts.

## 🔧 Pipeline at a glance

| Step | What it does | Output | Gate |
|------|--------------|--------|------|
| **1.0 + 1+2** | Intake — normalise any product intent → 8 categories + scoring, set `input_type` + confidence floor | `brief.md` · `brief.json` | `validate_brief.py` |
| **2.3** | User Research — personas / JTBD / pains (+ conditional journey / opportunities) | `research.json` | `validate_research.py` |
| **2.3b** | Interview + Affinity — simulated persona role-play → affinity map (honesty-gated) | `interviews.json` | `validate_interviews.py` |
| **2.4** | Competitive Analysis | `competitive.json` | `validate_competitive.py` |
| **2.5** | Product Intelligence — 10 dims → `design_directives` (+ feature + persona coverage) | `intelligence.json` | `validate_intelligence.py` |
| **2.5b** | Scenario Edge Discovery — 10 dims → their edge; injects missing flows into Step 3 | `scenario-edges.json` | `validate_scenario_edges.py` |
| **2.6** | Aesthetic Direction — full identity theme + typography hierarchy | `aesthetic.json` · `brand.config.json` | `validate_aesthetic.py` |
| **3** | Refine user flows from directives (+ injected 2.5b flows) | `flows.json` | `validate_flows.py` |
| **3.5** | Screens from flows + DS mapping + `image_needs` (+ feature/scoring coverage) | `screen-inventory.json` · `design-first-draft.md` | `validate_screens.py` |
| **3.7** | Edge-Case Analysis (UI Stack × CORRECT) per Must screen | `edge-cases.json` | `validate_edgecases.py` |
| **4** | Scaffold the Next.js prototype (+ free-license asset-prep) | `output/prototype/` | — |
| **4.6** | Scored critique → auto-fix critical + quick wins | `docs/critique.md` | (agent) |
| **4.7** | **Audit gate** — 11 checks (token · WCAG · copy · contracts · font · theme · directive · screens · edges · font-fidelity · axis) · `finalize-prototype.sh` chains it `--strict` + critique + usability | `docs/audit-report.md` | `audit_prototype.py` 🔴 exit 1 |
| **4.7b** | Runtime audit (opt-in) — axe · states · focus-trap · taste · **geometry + universal-design** | — | Playwright (skips cleanly) |
| **4.7c** | Storybook QA (opt-in) | — | `addon-a11y` axe pass |
| **4.8** | Usability Test — heuristic + automated + simulated persona walkthrough | `usability.json` | `validate_usability.py` |
| **4.9** | Feedback Loop — score real test feedback → the next prototype | `test-findings.json` | `validate_test_findings.py` |
| **5** | Figma output (5 pages: Cover/Foundations/Components/Screens/Flows) — generated from artifacts | Figma file | `figma_prep.py` + Figma MCP |

---

## 🧠 Product Intelligence Layer (Step 2.5)

Between the brief and the UI, the pipeline infers **10 measurable product dimensions** — each with
**evidence + confidence** — and rolls them up into an open **`design_directives`** object. Any
domain is expressible as a vector; there are no fixed presets.

`User Types · Expertise · Goals · Core Tasks · Workflow Complexity · Data Density · Error Tolerance · Accessibility · Compliance · Decision Criticality`

```
design_directives = { density_target 1–5, guidance_level, safeguard_level,
                      a11y_target, mandatory_flows[], navigation_model, trust_emphasis }
```

`validate_intelligence.py` enforces **cross-dimension invariants** (e.g. `safety_critical ⇒
error_tolerance low/zero`, public-sector ⇒ AAA) and **confidence gating** (low confidence →
wireframe-level output + a human gate). Spec: [`intelligence-layer.md`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/intelligence-layer.md).

---

## 🎨 Aesthetic Direction (Step 2.6)

`design_directives` decides the *functional* shape; Step 2.6 decides the **look**. It commits a
visual direction and resolves it into concrete tokens — so the prototype earns a real aesthetic
instead of the neutral shadcn default ("design slop").

- **138-brand library** — `references/aesthetics/design-systems/library/<name>/DESIGN.md`
  (apple, linear-app, stripe, vercel, notion, resend, brutalism, glassmorphism, luxury…).
  Browse: `python3 …/aesthetics/scripts/design_systems.py list | search <term> | show <name>`.
- **Anti-slop first** — name the one `mood_adjective` the result must earn before any token.
- **Typography as a decision** — commits an explicit hierarchy (scale · size · weight · leading) with
  **weight-driven emphasis**, not colour/italic; the gate rejects a "weight" strategy that uses one weight.
- **From a mockup** — if the TOR ships a screenshot, infer the direction from it ([`image-to-code.md`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/image-to-code.md)).
- **Full identity, not just a primary** — it resolves the whole semantic set (surfaces, text
  hierarchy, accent, border) for **light *and* dark**, so the chosen system's character actually
  lands instead of a brand colour slapped on a neutral skeleton.
- **Gate** — `validate_aesthetic.py` **recomputes WCAG contrast from the hex values itself**
  (never trusts the agent), requires the chosen system to resolve in the library, demands the full
  light+dark identity set, and forces `a11y_target`/`density_target` to echo `design_directives`.

Output `aesthetic.json` + a ready-to-apply `output/brand.config.json` (carrying the whole theme) for
`/generate-prototype` — and audit **gate 6** blocks if the build regresses to neutral.

**Beyond colour — themeable axes + DS-native theming.** When a DS ships a `token-contract.json` that
exposes **`axis_tokens`** — non-colour design axes (`ease · duration · leading · tracking ·
weight_heading · container · section`). So a product can theme typography/motion/layout, not just
colour, from one config. The multi-product path: `brand.config.json` → `npx ds-brand-build` →
`app/brand.css` → `@import "./brand.css"` in `globals.css`. The DS root stays the single source of
token **names** (`token-contract.json`: colour + scalar + axis); each product is one config. The
token tiers are **primitive → semantic → component** (Tailwind's `@theme`/`--color-*` is the
*utility-binding* layer, not a tier). Gates 2 / 6 / 11 follow the local `@import`, so this verifies
end-to-end without losing any check.

---

## 🔁 Quality loop — scored, then gated

**Step 4.6 — Critique (scored)** · [`critique-framework.md`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/critique-framework.md) → [`design-review.md`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/design-review.md)

- Score **6 weighted dimensions** (Hierarchy 20 · Consistency 20 · Accessibility 20 · Usability 20 · Responsiveness 10 · Performance 10) → weighted overall (≤6 = rework).
- Flag **Nielsen's 10 heuristics** by number · run the **anti-slop gate** (Banned Defaults: pure #000/#fff, identical cards, rainbow accents, emoji-as-icons, em-dash copy…).
- **Mobile lens** ([`mobile-usability.md`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/mobile-usability.md)) for mobile-first products — touch targets ≥44px, thumb reach, correct input types, 320px reflow, no hover-only. Also applied when screens are generated (Step 3.5).
- Auto-fix every 🔴 Critical + ⚡ Quick Win; log the rest for Dev.

**Step 4.7 — Audit gate (a real script)** · `audit_prototype.py`

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/designops-pipeline/scripts/audit_prototype.py \
  output/prototype --a11y AA --report output/prototype/docs/audit-report.md
```

| # | Gate | How it's checked | Result |
|---|------|------------------|--------|
| 1 | **Token compliance** | `lint_hardcodes.py` — no raw hex/px/ms or `bg-gray-500`-style palette | 🔴 block |
| 2 | **WCAG contrast** | recomputes ratios from `globals.css` (oklch→sRGB), light **and** dark, at the a11y target | 🔴 block |
| 3 | **UX copy** | no emoji / em-dash in product UI | 🔴 block |
| 4 | **Component contracts** | `lint_component_contracts.py` — icon-only buttons need a name, every `DialogContent` a `DialogTitle`, labelled `Input` a matching `FieldLabel htmlFor` | 🔴 block |
| 5 | **Font imports** | `lint_font_imports.py` — no remote-font CSS `@import` (500s the Turbopack dev server; use `next/font`) | 🔴 block |
| 6 | **Theme fidelity** | `lint_theme_fidelity.py` — the identity theme Step 2.6 committed in `brand.config.json` is actually applied in `globals.css` (no regression to the neutral default) | 🔴 block |
| 7 | **Directive fidelity** | `lint_directive_fidelity.py` — the build honors `design_directives`: destructive actions guarded when `safeguard_level` is on, an empty-state when `guidance_level` is guided (density/nav advisory) | 🔴 block |
| 8 | **Screen coverage** | `lint_screen_coverage.py` — every **Must** screen in `screen-inventory.json` was built as an `app/<route>/page.tsx` rendering its declared loading/empty/error states | 🔴 block |
| 9 | **Edge-case coverage** | `lint_edge_coverage.py` — every **Must** edge in `edge-cases.json` is handled in its screen (empty/error/loading/partial state · inline validation · destructive confirm) | 🔴 block |
| 10 | **Font fidelity** | `lint_font_fidelity.py` — the committed `font_sans` actually reaches `layout`/`globals.css` (not the scaffold default) | 🔴 block |
| 11 | **Axis fidelity** | `lint_axis_fidelity.py` — the non-colour axes (type leading/weight, pill shape, motion easing) committed in `aesthetic.json` are applied in the CSS | 🔴 block |

> Gates 6-11 auto-discover their source artifact (`brand.config.json` / `intelligence.json` /
> `screen-inventory.json` / `edge-cases.json` / `aesthetic.json`) beside the prototype, or take
> `--theme` / `--intel` / `--screens` / `--edges` / `--aesthetic`, and skip cleanly when absent.
> Gates 2 / 6 / 11 also follow a local `@import "./brand.css"` (DS-native theming — see below).
>
> **`finalize-prototype.sh` is the enforcement seam:** it always runs the audit (`--strict` on a
> complete build, so a skipped artifact-backed gate counts as a failure) plus the critique +
> usability integrity checks — so the audit can't be silently forgotten before handoff.
> `bash …/scripts/finalize-prototype.sh output/prototype --a11y AA`

> **Exit 1 = BLOCKED** — handoff/Figma is blocked until it passes. Categories are machine-checked,
> not eyeballed. It audits the **generated surface only** (`components/ui` and any `docs/` dir are
> auto-excluded), so just point it at the prototype — no `--scan` needed; add `--include-vendored` to audit everything.

**Step 4.7b — Runtime audit (optional)** · [`runtime-audit/`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/runtime-audit/README.md)

Renders the built page in headless Chrome (Playwright) to catch what source can't show — **axe-core**
(button/link names, image alt, `lang`, ARIA, landmarks, heading order), **hover/focus-state contrast**,
modal **focus-trap**, a render-based **anti-slop** report, plus a **geometry + universal-design** audit
(8pt-grid spacing · WCAG 2.2 §2.5.8 target size · min text · optical misalignment). Opt-in; skips cleanly
without Playwright.
```bash
node scripts/runtime/audit_runtime.mjs out/index.html   # after npm run build, in the prototype
```

**Step 4.9 — Feedback Loop (test → prototype N+1)** · [`feedback-loop.md`](.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/references/feedback-loop.md) → `validate_test_findings.py`

The loop that makes it iterative. Real test feedback becomes a scored work-list: each finding is
**de-solutionised** (the underlying problem, not the user's proposed fix), classified **observed vs
stated** (behaviour > opinion), judged into a **verdict** (`systemic` cross-segment · `segment` ·
`individual` n=1), and scored `priority_score = severity × reach × confidence`. Fix the top-N in budget
(→ `target_iteration`), backlog the rest, and stop when new findings dry up. A finding that confirms an
upstream guess upgrades it **inferred → evidence** — real-user feedback is the one thing the synthetic
front-end isn't.

## ✅ Requirements

| Requirement | Needed for | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | reading the TOR + generating every artifact | **Required.** Without it the runner only stages prompts and produces no output. |
| **Python ≥ 3.9** | every validator + audit gate + DS inventory scan | **Stdlib only — no `pip install`.** (3.9+ for `list[str]` typing.) |
| **Node.js ≥ 18** | building the prototype (`npm install && npm run dev`) | **Model B:** installs the DS checkout's own **public** deps — no token. **Model A:** imports a published package (needs network + `GITHUB_TOKEN`). |
| **your shadcn DS** | the build base (Model B) + the component inventory (Step 3.5) | A local shadcn checkout (a Next app with `components/ui` + tokens + `globals.css`). Point `--ds` / `--ds-src` at it. |
| **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** | **Model A only** — installing a published DS package from GitHub Packages | Not needed for Model B. `export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)`; public packages still need auth on GitHub Packages. |
| **poppler** (`pdftotext`) | better PDF text extraction | Optional — falls back to Claude reading the PDF. `brew install poppler`. |
| Playwright · Lighthouse · Figma MCP | Steps 4.7b / performance / 5 | Optional — these steps **skip cleanly** when the tool is absent. |

**Cloning this repo to use elsewhere?** The pipeline itself is pure stdlib/bash; the only external piece
is the DS, and **Model B keeps it self-contained**:

- **Model B (recommended):** point `--ds` / `--ds-src` at your own **shadcn source checkout** — the build
  copies it in and installs its **public** deps. No package registry, no `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- **Model A (legacy):** import a published `@scope/design-system` package — needs registry access + a
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Point `--ds` at that DS's **source checkout** — it is read only for
  the component inventory + `token-contract.json` + DESIGN.md (Steps 2.6 / 3.5); the build still
  imports the published package.

## 🧪 Tests

```bash
bash .claude/skills/designops-pipeline/scripts/selftest.sh        # 161/161, runs on macOS stock bash 3.2
```

Covers bash-3.2 compatibility, every validator (valid passes / invalid fails), the full 11-gate audit
(fake brand, low contrast, hardcode, emoji, neutral-theme regression, missing safeguard, unbuilt Must
screen, unhandled edge case, un-applied font/axis all blocked), the Discover/Define honesty gates
(fabricated evidence, non-simulated interview, uncovered persona, high-impact opportunity without a
research question), the scenario-edge severity floors, intake confidence floor, typography weight-emphasis,
image provenance, the feedback-loop scoring math, feature/scoring traceability, the import-only setup, and
the DTCG token gates. **Run it after editing any script** in `.claude/skills/designops-pipeline/scripts/`.

## 🧱 The design system — two models

**Model B (recommended) — build off a local shadcn checkout.** Point `--ds-src` at your DS source (a
Next app with `components/ui` + tokens + `globals.css`, e.g. `pobe-m/shadcn-skills-design`).
`setup-prototype.sh` copies it into `output/prototype` and runs a plain `npm install` of its **public**
deps — **no package registry, no `GITHUB_TOKEN`.** Components are the DS's own `components/ui/*`
(editable), imported via `@/components/ui/<name>`; theme via the Step 2.6 `brand.config.json` appended to
`globals.css`. Verified end-to-end (`npm install` + `next build` pass with no token).

**Model A (legacy) — import a published DS package.** `setup-prototype.sh --ds-pkg @scope/design-system@x.y.z`
installs a pinned package (`--save-exact`) from a registry and imports `@scope/design-system/<name>`
(immutable, in `node_modules`); a scoped GitHub-Packages install requires `GITHUB_TOKEN`
(`export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)`). `run_pipeline.sh` resolves `--ds` (the DS SOURCE, read only for
inventory/token-contract): `TOR_DS_PATH` env → a sibling checkout.

`setup-prototype.sh` scaffolds the Tailwind-v4 guards every prototype needs: `@source not "../public"`
+ `@source not "../.next"` (v4 auto-source-detection otherwise reads binary `*.webp`/`*.png` as text →
garbage classes → Turbopack 500), a Next `.gitignore`, and a `.vscode/settings.json` that silences the
false "Unknown at rule" lint on `@source`/`@theme`/`@apply`.

The `--handoff` token bridge (hex → oklch into a whitelabel repo) is **deprecated**. Theming is owned by
Step 2.6 → the product scaffold (the `brand.config.json` appended to `globals.css`), so there is no
token-bridge step in the normal flow. The flag is kept for back-compat only
against a repo that still ships `brand.config.json` + `npm run brand:build` (never the DS repo).
