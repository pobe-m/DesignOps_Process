"""Gate for critique.json (Step 4.6 — scored critique, judge-separated).

Integrity-first, mirroring the browser-use `qa` skill's judge pattern: the
agent that BUILT the prototype must not be the sole authority on whether it
passes. Step 4.6 now emits a structured critique with an INDEPENDENT judge
verdict, and this gate enforces the one rule that makes the separation real:

    a failed judge verdict CAPS the score — a high self-score cannot rescue
    a build the judge says is broken.

(See references/critique-framework.md "Structured output + judge" for the
schema and why the judge is a separate pass.)
